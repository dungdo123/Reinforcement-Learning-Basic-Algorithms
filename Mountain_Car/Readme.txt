This folder contains some RL algorithms to solve Mountain Car problems.

The Mountain_car enviroment is refered to gym library, OpenAI.

All algorithms are implemented from " Reinforcement Learning:
An Introduction",Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto, prof. David Silver and prof. Jun Pyo Hong courses
